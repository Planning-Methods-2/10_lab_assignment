# [100 points] Based on the data for your final project, do the following

## 1. Define the model specification based on theory and practical constraints (data, research design, etc.)
## 2. Explore the data creating relational plots (scatter plot, box-plot, histograms, etc.). Check the basic assumptions (continuous variables, number of NAs, correlations, etc.)
## 3. Estimate a basic OLS model, interpret results, check R-squared, F and T statistics.
## 4. Run some diagnostic tests to rule out issues (Heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation, etc)
## 5. Change model specification if needed and return to step 3.
